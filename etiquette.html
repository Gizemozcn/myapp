	stick to it. Call ahead if you are going to be more than 15 minutes late, and 
	cancel as far in advance as possible if your plans change so that someone 
	else can get a table. Some restaurants take credit card numbers to hold 
	reservations and charge no-show fees.<br>

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as you

wipe your face with the napkin. NEVER use it to wipe your nose!</font></p>

		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you excuse yourself from the table, loosely fold the napkin and place it to the left or 
right of your plate. Do not refold your napkin or wad it up on the table either. Never place your napkin on your chair.</p>

		<p>At the end of the meal, leave the napkin semi-folded at the left side of the place setting. It should not be crumpled or 
twisted; nor should it be folded. The napkin must also not be left on the chair.<br>&nbsp;</font></p>

	Use the silverware farthest from your plate first. </font></b></p>
	
<p align="left">
<b>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Here's the Silverware and dinnerware rule:</b>
<b><font color="#800000">Eat to your left, drink to your right. Any food dish to the left is yours, and any glass to the right is yours.</font></b></p>

<p>Starting with the knife, fork, or spoon that is farthest from your plate, work your way in, using one utensil for each course. The salad 
fork is on your outermost left, followed by your dinner fork. Your soup spoon is on your outermost right, followed by your beverage spoon, salad knife and dinner 
knife. Your dessert spoon and fork are above your plate or brought out with dessert. <b> <font color="#800000">If you remember the rule to work from the outside in, you'll be fine.
</font> </b> <br></font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt; " align="left">
<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Use one of two methods when using the fork and knife:</font></b></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt; " align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>
		American Style:</b> </font>Knife in right hand, fork in left hand holding food. After a few bite-sized pieces of food are cut, place knife on edge of plate with 
	blades facing in. Eat food by switching fork to right hand (unless you are left handed). A left hand, arm or elbow on the table is bad manners.</font></p>
		
		<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt; " align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000">		
		<b>Continental/European Style:</b></font> Knife in right hand, fork in left hand.&nbsp;Eat food with fork still in 
	left hand. The difference is that you don't switch hands-you eat with your fork in your 
	left hand, with the prongs curving downward. Both utensils are kept in your hands with the tines pointed down 
		throughout the entire eating process. If you take a drink, you do not 
		just put your knife down, you put both utensils down into the resting 
		position: cross the fork over the knife.</font></p>
</blockquote>

	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once used, your utensils (including the handles), 
	<b><font color="#800000">must not touch the table again</font></b>. Always rest forks, knives, and spoons on the side of your plate 
	in the 4:20 position. </font></p>
	
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For more formal dinners, from course to course, your tableware will be taken away and replaced as needed. 
<font size="2" color="#800000"><b>To signal that your are done with the course, rest your fork, tines up, and knife blade in, with the handles resting at

	<br>
	<font face="Verdana" size="4">
	General Social and Dining Etiquette Rules:</font></b></p>



	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">	
	<b>
	<font color="#800000">Dress Code:</font></b> 
	Follow whatever dress code is requested on the invitation or suggested by the host/hostess.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b><font color="#800000">Arrival</font></b> Arrive <b>at least 10 minutes early</b> unless otherwise specified. <b>Never arrive late!</b></font></p>

<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b><font color="#800000">Hostess Gift:</font></b> It is proper to bring a small hostess gift, one that the hostess is not obliged to use that very 
evening. Gifts such as flowers, candy, wine, or dessert, are not good hostess gifts, as the hostess will feel that it must put it out immediately.
<b> <font color="#800000">You must not never expect your gift to be served at the dinner party.</font></b></font></p>

<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<font color="#800000"><b>Seating:</b></font> At a dinner party, wait for the host or hostess sits down before taking your seat. If the host/hostess 
asks you to sit, then do. At a very formal dinner party, if there are no name cards at the table, wait until the host indicates where you should 
sit. The seating will typically be man-woman-man-woman with the women seated to the right of the men. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000">Prayer:</font></b> A prayer or 'blessing' may be customary in some households. 
The dinner guests may join in or be respectfully silent. Most prayers are made by the host before the meal is eaten. </font></p>

<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b><font color="#800000">Toast</font></b> Sometimes a toast is offered instead of a prayer. Always join in with a toast. If the host stands up 
during the toast, also stand up.</font></p>

<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<font color="#800000"><b>End of Dinner:</b></font> Serving tea or coffee signifies that the formal part of the evening is over. Guests may now feel free to 
leave, or linger if the host or hostess encourages them to do so. </font></p>

<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<font color="#800000"><b>Thank You Note:</b></font> After a formal dinner party, a thank you note should be sent to the hostess. Depending on how well you 
know your hosts, a telephone call is also acceptable.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
<br>
<b>Serving food:</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
	
	<p align="left">
	<font size="2" face="Verdana">Food is served from the left. Dishes are removed from the right. </font></p>
	
	<p align="left">
	<font size="2" face="Verdana">Always say please when asking for something. At a restaurant, be sure to say thank you to 
	your server and bus boy after they have removed any used items. </font></p>
	
	<p align="left">
	<font size="2" face="Verdana">Butter, spreads, or dips should be transferred from the serving dish to 
	<b>your 
	plate</b> before spreading or eating. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Passing dishes or food:</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass 
		food from the left to the right. Do not stretch across the table, 
		crossing other guests, to reach food or condiments.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If another diner asks 
		for the salt or pepper, <b>pass both together</b>, even if a table mate asks 
		for only one of them. This is so dinner guests won't have to search for orphaned shakers. </font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Set any passed item, whether it's the salt and pepper shakers, a bread 
		basket, or a butter plate, <b>directly on the table</b> instead of passing hand-to-hand.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Never intercept a pass</b>. Snagging a roll out of the breadbasket or taking 
		a shake of salt when it is en route to someone else is a no-no.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Always <b>use serving utensils</b> to 
		serve yourself, not your personal silverware.</font></p>
		
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><br><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eating:</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>Do NOT talk with food in your 
		mouth</b></font>! This is very rude and distasteful to watch! Wait until you have 
		swallowed the food in your mouth.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Always taste your food before seasoning it. Usually the hostess has gone to a lot of 
		work making sure the food served is delicious to her standards. <b><font color="#800000">It is very rude to add salt and pepper before tasting the food.</font></b></font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Don't blow on your food to cool it off. If it is too hot to eat, take the hint and wait until it cools.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Always scoop food, using the proper utensil, <b><font color="#800000">away from you</font>.</b></font></p>
	
	
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cut only enough food for the next mouthful<b> <font color="#800000">(cut no more than two bites of food at a time)</font></b>. 
Eat in small bites and slowly.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Do eat a little of everything on your plate. If you do 
		not like the food and feel unable to give a compliment, <b><font color="#800000">just keep silent</font></b>. 
		It is acceptable to leave some food on your plate if you are full and have eaten enough. If the food 
		served is not to your liking, it is polite to at least attempt to eat a small amount of it. It is never acceptable to ask a person why they have 
		not eaten all the food. Don't make an issue if you don't like something or can't eat it - <b> <font color="#800000">keep silence</font>.</b></font></p>
		
	<blockquote>
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#800000">Even if you have dietary 
		restrictions, it is <b>inappropriate</b> to request food other than that which

		dietary restrictions or allergies, let your host know in <b> <u>advance of the 
		dinner</u></b>.</font></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Do not &quot;play with&quot; your food or 
		utensils. Never wave or point silverware. Do not hold food on the fork 
		or spoon while talking, nor wave your silverware in the air or point with it.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Try to <b>pace your eating</b> so that you 
		don&#8217;t finish before others are halfway through. If you are a slow eater, 
		try to speed up a bit on this occasion so you don&#8217;t hold everyone up.

<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Table Manners:</font></b></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfold your napkin and place it on your lap within 1 minute of sitting at the table to dine. When you are finished 
	with your dinner, place it loosely on the table, <b>not on the plate and never on your chair</b>.</p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Keep elbows off the table. Keep your left hand in your lap unless you are using it.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do <u>not</u> talk with your mouth full. Chew with your mouth closed.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Guests should do their best to mingle and make light conversation with everyone. <font color="#800000">
	<b>Do not talk excessively loud</b></font>. Give others equal opportunities for conversation. Talk about cheerful, pleasant things at the table.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Don't clean up spills with your own napkin and don't touch items that have 
		dropped on the floor. You can use your napkin to protect yourself from spills. Then, simply and politely ask your server to clean up and to 
		bring you a replacement for the soiled napkin or dirty utensil. </font></p>
		
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Loud eating noises such as slurping and burping are very impolite. <b> <font color="#800000">The number one sin of dinner table 
		etiquette!</font></b></font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do not blow your nose at the dinner table. Excuse yourself to visit the 
		restroom. Wash your hands before returning to the dining room. If you cough, cover your mouth with your napkin to stop the spread of germs and 
		muffle the noise. If your cough becomes unmanageable, excuse yourself to visit the restroom. Wash your hands before returning to the dining room. </font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#800000"><b>Turn off your cell phone or switch it to silent</b></font> or vibrate mode before sitting 
		down to eat, and leave it in your pocket or purse. <b><font color="#800000">It is impolite to answer a phone during dinner.</font></b> If you must make or take a call, excuse 
		yourself from the table and step outside of the restaurant.</font></p>
		
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do not use a toothpick or apply makeup at the table.</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Say &quot;Excuse me,&quot; or &quot;I'll be right 
		back,&quot; before leaving the table. <b> <font color="#800000">Do not say that you are going to the restroom.</font></b></font></p>

	<p align="left">Once used, your utensils, including the handles, 
	<b><font color="#800000">must not touch the table again</font></b>. Always rest forks, knives, and spoons on the side of your 
	plate or in the bowl. When you are finished with a course, place your utensils (silverware) used on your place in the 4:20 position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>Wine:</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Never turn a wine glass upside down to decline wine. It is more polite to let

		over the wine glass to signal that you don't want any wine.</font></b></font></p>
		
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hold your wine glass by the stem, not the rim.

	<b>Appetizers, Hors d'oeuvres, Canapés:</b></font></p>
	
<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Food that is served at a cocktail party or during a pre-meal 
	cocktail hour is intended to be eaten with the fingers. This includes olives, pickles, nuts, canapés, deviled eggs, and chips.</font> </p>

<p align="left">
	<b><br><font face="Verdana" size="2">
	Artichokes:</b></font></p>
	
<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is both proper and polite to 
	pluck the leaves with your fingers, leaving fork and knife aside for now. </font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pull off a leaf, holding it by the pointed end. 
Put the other end in your mouth and pull it between your teeth, scraping the 
length of the leaf (the edible portion of the leaves becomes greater as you get 
closer to the center of the artichoke).</font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just before you get to the very center, leaves 
will become almost white with purple tips. Be careful of these leaves because 
their purple ends are prickly. When the leaves are pulled, you will be left with 
the base, the heart, crowned with a fuzzy patch. You have now reached the best 
part of all, the very reason for eating artichokes: the heart. Carefully scoop 
away the fuzzy stuff with your knife or spoon (though a properly prepared 
artichoke will already have the choke removed). With knife and fork, cut bites 
from the heart like pieces of prime fillet. </font></p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you're provided with a dip such as a 
vinaigrette or mayonnaise, put a small part of the edible portion of the leaf in 
the dip and scrape with your teeth as directed above. Don't overdo it on the dip 
or you won't taste the artichoke. </font></p>

<b>Asparagus:</font></b></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most etiquette books say that you can eat whole asparagus

and use your knife and fork to cut and eat them. <u>Only</u> pick asparagus up with your hands if the hostess does.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Break slices of bread, rolls and muffins in 
half or in small pieces never larger than one bite. Butter each bite at a time. Small biscuits do not

<b>Caviar:&nbsp; </b></font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To preserve the full flavor of caviar, scoop it 
out using mother-of-pearl utensils, and <strong>NEVER </strong> use a metallic 
spoon (metal oxidizes the eggs), which will create an unwanted (and pretty 
horrid) metal bite. If necessary use a wood or plastic spoon.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do not mush caviar up while you&#8217;re serving yourself 
or others, lift the spoon carefully. Caviar should be scooped from the container 
vertically from top to bottom to avoid crushing the egg.</p>

<p>If caviar is passed to you in a bowl or crock with its own spoon, serve a teaspoonful onto your plate. As the following accompaniments are offered, use 
the individual serving spoon in each to take small amount of minced onion and sieved egg whites and yolks, as well as a few lemon slices and a couple of toast 
points. Assemble a canapé to your taste with a knife, then use your fingers to lift it to your mouth. </font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are at a cocktail party or reception, where 
prepared caviar canapés are being passed on trays, simply lift one off the plate and pop it into your mouth. </font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When served caviar as an hors d'oeuvre, no matter how much you might be tempted by its luscious flavor. It's considered bad taste 
to eat more than an ample serving of about two ounces, or about two spoonfuls. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Depending on your dining 
	situation, you can either choose to eat olives or leave them on the plate. 
	If you are on a job interview, do not eat them. Also, in a highly formal 
	dinner, do not eat them unless you host or hostess does. The best 
	tactic is to watch what your host or hostess does, then do the same.</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The perfect method for eating spaghetti or other long stringy pasta is to twirl 
it around your fork. Use a spoon to help if needed. </p>
	
	<p align="left">It is also acceptable to cut pasta with a knife and fork. You can get some leverage by turning the pasta while holding the tines of your 
	fork against the edge of your plate. It is even correct to neatly cut the pasta if twirling is too hard. </font></p>
								
	<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is undeniably bad manners

	It is often loud, and it is never pretty.</font></p>

	With your Sushi order, you will be served some pickled ginger, a small mound of wasabi, and soy sauce. Eat a slice of pickled ginger after each variety of sushi to cleanse your

	Eat the whole sushi roll at once. It is not appropriate to eat part of a piece of sushi and place the

    <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
	Do not dip the rice portion of the sushi pieces into the soy sauce as it becomes too moist and can cause
